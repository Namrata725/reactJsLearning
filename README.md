# React Project Setup with Vite

## Overview - React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive experience. It lets you build reusable UI components and manage state efficiently.

## Why React

- Component-based architecture
- Fast and efficient rendering with virtual DOM
- Large community and ecosystem
- Suitable for complex frontend applications

## Overview - Vite

Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It uses native ES modules and starts the server instantly.

## Why Vite

- Lightning-fast cold starts
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates
- Optimized build using Rollup
- Easy configuration for React and other frameworks

## Getting Started

### Installation of Node.js and npm

Install Node.js (which comes with npm) from the official site:

`https://nodejs.org/`

## Why install Node.js and npm?

- **Node.js** is required to run JavaScript tools on your system.
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** is used to manage project dependencies like React, Vite, etc.

## Getting Started with React + Vite

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## My First React Code

Once the project is set up, replace the content of `src/App.jsx` with the following code:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <h2>This is my first React App</h2>
      <p>My name is namrata...</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## What is a Component in React?

A **component** in React is a **reusable piece of UI**. It works like a JavaScript function but returns JSX (HTML-like code).

```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, Namrata!</h1>;
}
```

---

## How to Use a Component

To use a component, call it like an HTML tag inside JSX:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome />
    </div>
  );
}

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, Namrata!</h1>;
}
```

> Component names must start with an uppercase letter.

---

## Difference Between a Component and a Function

| Aspect          | Function                          | Component                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Purpose         | Performs logic and returns values | Returns JSX (UI)            |
| Return Type     | Numbers, strings, etc.            | JSX (HTML-like structure)   |
| Naming          | Can be lowercase                  | Must start with uppercase   |
| React-specific? | No                                | Yes                         |
| Used in JSX     | No                                | Yes, like `<MyComponent />` |

### Example:

#### file name:Header.jsx

- since we are using component in new file so we have to import file in App.jsx :import Header from "./Header.JSX" and call inside App component :

---

```jsx

function Header() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>header</h3>
      <h3>{greet()}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}

function greet() {
  return "Hello from greet function!";
}

export default Header;

App.jsx

import Header from "./Header";
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

# Understanding JSX in React

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, making it easier to create React elements.

---

## What is JSX?

JSX lets you write UI in a syntax similar to HTML, but with the full power of JavaScript.

- You can embed expressions inside `{}`
- It’s not mandatory, but it's widely used in React for simplicity and clarity
- JSX is **compiled into `React.createElement()`** behind the scenes

---

### 1. User Variable

Embed variables inside JSX:

```jsx
function MyName() {
  const name = "World";
  return <h4>Hello {name}!</h4>;
}
```

---

### 2. User function

```jsx
function sub(a, b) {
  // function
  return (
    <div>
      <h4>
        a - b= {a} - {b}= {a - b}
      </h4>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

### 3. User condition

```jsx
function ValidAge() {
  const age = 25;
  if (age >= 18) return <h4>You are an adult</h4>; //condition inside JSX curly braces
  return <h4>You are a minor</h4>;
}
```

---

### 4.Operation

```jsx
function operation(a, b, op) {
  if (op === "+") return a + b;
  if (op === "-") return a - b;
  if (op === "*") return a * b;
  if (op === "/") return a / b;

  function sub(a, b) {
    // function
    return (
      <div>
        <h4>
          a - b= {a} - {b}= {a - b}
        </h4>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Usage:
<h4>Result = {operation(12, 3, "/")}</h4>;
```

---

### 5. Object and Array

```jsx
function MyObject() {
  const person = {
    name: "Namrata",
    age: 25,
    city: "Kathmandu",
  };
  return (
    <h4>
      {person.name} is {person.age} years old and lives in {person.city}
    </h4>
  ); //calling object inside JSX curly braces
}

function MyArray() {
  const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
  return <h4>{fruits[0]} is the first fruit</h4>; //calling array inside JSX curly braces
}
```

---

### 6.HTML Tags

```jsx
const path = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714d2f9gQGL.jpg";

<img src={path} alt="Example" style={{ width: "200px", height: "200px" }} />;
```

#### create file and export it then import to Appp : file name: JSXCurlyBraces.

---

## BtnClick React Component

This is a simple React component that demonstrates:

- JavaScript vs. React functions
- Handling button clicks
- Using arrow functions
- Passing parameters to functions in `onClick` events

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Difference Between JavaScript Function and React Function

| JavaScript Function            | React Function (Component)        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Can exist anywhere in JS files | Specifically used for UI in React |
| Returns any value              | Returns JSX                       |
| Used for logic or utilities    | Used to define components         |
| `function greet() {}`          | `function MyComponent() {}`       |

---

### 2. Steps

#### Step 1: Make a Function

```js
function handleClick1() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
}
```

#### Step 2: Make a Button

<button onClick={handleClick1}>Click Me</button>

#### Step 3: Call an Arrow Function

```js
const handleClick2 = () => {
  alert("Arrow function clicked!");
};
```

#### Step 4: Pass Parameters to a Function

```js
const fruit = (name) => {
  alert(name);
};

<button onClick={() => fruit("apple")}>Apple</button>
<button onClick={() => fruit("banana")}>Banana</button>
```

# Understanding state in React

## what is state in React JS ?

State is a container to store data like variable. State is mutable and dynamic . we have to import it when we want to use it. It re-render component automatically so that data can visible on UI.

## what is hooks in React JS?

Hooks are the special feature for function component . hooks let you use different feature from your components. Eg: state , life cycle moment , side effect etc

### example

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function UseState() {
  const [fruit, setValue] = useState("apple");
  const btnClick = () => {
    if (fruit === "apple") {
      setValue("banana");
    } else {
      setValue("apple");
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>UseState Example</h1>
      <p>Current fruit: {fruit}</p>
      <button onClick={btnClick}>Change Fruit</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UseState;
```

## Toggle or Hide and show in React JS

### steps

- define state
- update state on btn click
- add condition for toggle
- hide and show component

### What Are Props?

In React, **props** (short for **properties**) are a way to pass **data from a parent component to a child component**. They make components dynamic and reusable by allowing them to receive different values.

Props are **read-only**, meaning a component cannot modify the props it receives — it can only use or display them.

---

## Components in This Project

### 1. `UserComponent`

**Purpose**: Acts as the central component that organizes and manages the data being passed to other components.

- It receives various types of props from its parent (`Props.jsx`), such as:
  - Simple variables (`name`, `age`)
  - Objects (`user`, `user2`)
  - An array (`country`)
  - State and state updater function (`student`, `setStudent`)
- It then delegates and passes these props to the appropriate child components (`VariableProps`, `ObjectProps`, `ArrayProps`, and `ClickProps`) for display or interaction.
- It also handles a **click event** to prompt the user for input, updates the state with `setStudent`, and conditionally renders the `ClickProps` component with the new value.

---

### 2. `VariableProps`

**Purpose**: Simple data types like `name` and `age` are passed as individual props to show how primitive values can be rendered in child components (`VariableProps`).

```jsx
<VariableProps name={name} age={age} />
```

**Data type**: Variable (string, number)

**Display**: Shows a welcome message using `name` and `age`.

---

### 3. `ObjectProps`

**Purpose**: Complex data structures like user details (`user`, `user2`) are passed to demonstrate how you can access nested properties inside components (`ObjectProps`).

```jsx
<ObjectProps user={user} user2={user2} />
```

**Data type**: Object

**Display**: Displays properties like `name`, `age`, and `email` from each object.

---

### 4. `ArrayProps`

**Purpose**: A list of country names is passed as an array to show how to iterate over arrays using `.map()` and render each item (`ArrayProps`).

```jsx
<ArrayProps country={country} />
```

**Data type**: Array

**Display**: Uses `.map()` to loop through the array and render a `<li>` for each country.

---

### 5. `ClickProps`

**Purpose**: Demonstrates how to update and pass props through user interaction (click event).

```jsx
<ClickProps student={student} />
```

- A prompt appears when clicking the button.
- The entered name is saved to state and passed as a prop to be displayed.

---

## More About Props in React

This project demonstrates advanced usage of props in React by covering:

- **Default Props**: Provide fallback values to props.
- **Passing JSX using `children`**: Compose reusable layouts.
- **Changing Styles Dynamically with Props**: Make components flexible and customizable.

## Components Overview

### Default Props

In React, you can assign default values directly in the function parameter. This prevents `undefined` issues when props are not passed.

```jsx
function MoreProps({ name = "New User" }) {
  return <p>Name: {name}</p>;
}
```

Even if `name` isn't passed, `"New User"` will be shown.

---

### Passing JSX using `children`

Props in React can contain JSX by using the `children` prop. This allows you to reuse layout components and inject different content inside.

```jsx
<Wrapper>
  <p>Wrapper no: 1</p>
</Wrapper>

<Wrapper>
  <p>Wrapper no: 2</p>
  <h4>Register Please</h4>
</Wrapper>
```

In the `Wrapper` component, `children` automatically represents the content between its opening and closing tags.

```jsx
function Wrapper({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
}
```

---

### Changing Styles Dynamically with Props

You can make components highly customizable by using props for styling.

```jsx
function Wrapper({ children, color = "orange" }) {
  return <div style={{ color: color }}>{children}</div>;
}
```

When you pass the `color` prop, it overrides the default color:

```jsx
<Wrapper color="green">
  <p>This text will be green</p>
</Wrapper>
```

---

## GetInputField Component

A simple **React functional component** that demonstrates how to handle user input using the `useState` hook. It allows users to enter text, display it below the input field, and clear the input with a button.

### Code Example

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function GetInputField() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const changeName = (event) => {
    setName(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleClear = () => {
    setName("");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>user</h1>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Name"
        onChange={changeName}
        value={name}
      />
      <h4>{name}</h4>
      <button onClick={handleClear}>Clear all</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default GetInputField;
```

### explaination

- **State Management:**
- The component uses `useState` to hold the `name` value.
- **Event Handling:**
  - The `changeName` function updates the `name` state when the user types into the input field.
  - The `handleClear` function resets the `name` state to an empty string when the "Clear all" button is clicked.
- **Rendering:**

  - The input field displays the current value of `name`.
  - The entered name is also displayed below the input field in a `<h4>` tag.
  - The "Clear all" button clears the input field and resets the name to an empty string.

## Controlled Component in React

### What is a Controlled Component?

A **controlled component** is a form element (like an input field) whose value is controlled by **React state**. In other words, the value of the input is set and updated by React, making the component predictable and manageable.

### How to Identify a Controlled Component?

A controlled component typically:

- **Stores the input field value in state**.
- **Uses an event handler (like `onChange`) to update state** when the user interacts with the input field.
- **Sets the `value` attribute of the input to the state value**.

### Benefits of Controlled Components

**Single Source of Truth**: All form data lives in React state, making it easy to manage and debug.  
**Validation and Manipulation Before Submit**: Data can be validated, formatted, or transformed in the component itself.  
**Dynamic Updates**: Inputs can respond to state changes instantly (e.g., resetting, conditional rendering).

### Example Code: Controlled Component in React

file name: ControlledComponent.jsx

---

## Handle Checkbox in React

In this example, we create multiple checkboxes representing various skills. We use a state variable to keep track of the selected skills.

### what it covers

- **Create multiple checkboxes**
- **Define a state variable to track checkbox values**
- **Add checkbox value to state when checked**
- **Remove checkbox value from state when unchecked**

### Benefits

- Easy management of multiple selections
- Dynamic state updates based on user interaction
- Helps with forms that require multiple selections

---

### Example Code: Handle Checkbox in React file: HandleCheckbox.jsx

## Handling Radio Buttons and Dropdown in React

This example demonstrates how to handle radio buttons and dropdown lists using controlled components in React.

### what it covers

- Make a radio button
- Get radio button value in state
- Default selection of radio button
- Make dropdown
- Get dropdown value in state
- Default selection in dropdown

## Features

### 1. Handle Radio Button (Gender Selection)

- Uses `useState` to store the selected gender.
- Updates gender based on the selected radio button.
- Uses the `checked` attribute to bind selection to state.

### 2. Handle Dropdown (City Selection)

- Uses `useState` to store the selected city.
- Dropdown value is updated using `onChange` handler.
- Initially defaults to `"Kathmandu"`.

## example code: Handle Radio Button and Dropdown in React file: HandleRadioButtonAndDropdown.jsx

---

# Looping with `map()` Function in React

This example demonstrates how to use JavaScript arrays and React's `map()` function to dynamically render content such as a table.

---

## What is Covered

- What is an array?
- How to define an array in React?
- How to create a static HTML table
- How to use the `map()` function for looping and rendering elements in JSX

---

## What is an Array?

An array is a collection of items stored in a single variable. In JavaScript and React, arrays are commonly used to store lists of data.

Example:

```js
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date"];
```

### What is an Array of Objects?

An array of objects is a list where each element is an object, and each object can hold multiple key-value pairs.

```jsx
const fruitsData = [
  { id: 1, name: "Apple", color: "Red", price: 120 },
  { id: 2, name: "Banana", color: "Yellow", price: 50 },
  { id: 3, name: "Cherry", color: "Red", price: 200 },
  { id: 4, name: "Graps", color: "Green", price: 150 },
  { id: 5, name: "Orange", color: "Orange", price: 80 },
];
```

### example code: Looping with `map()` Function in React file: LoopingWithMapFunction.jsx

# Looping Through Components with Props in React

This example demonstrates how to dynamically render multiple React components using an array of user data. It covers best practices like reusable components, looping with `.map()`, passing props, and adding inline styles.

---

## What is Covered?

- Create a reusable component
- Use `.map()` function to loop over data in JSX
- Render a component multiple times using loop
- Pass data as props from parent to child
- Apply inline styling for each component

---

## Key Concepts

### Component-Based Structure

React is built around reusable components. Here, we use a `LoopComponentUser` component to display individual user information.

### Array of Objects

An array of objects is used to store user data, where each object contains:

```js
{
  Id: 1,
  UserName: "Ram",
  Age: 23,
  email: "ram@example.com"
}

```

### The .map() Method

The .map() function is used to loop through the array and render each user in its own LoopComponentUser component.

### example code : LooopComponent.jsx

---

### Nested Looping in React

In this example, we have a nested loop using the `.map()` function. The outer loop iterates over an array of user data, and the inner loop loops through the user's friends array.

## What is Covered?

- Understand array of objects with nested arrays
- Implement **outer loop** to display parent data (Schools)
- Implement **inner loop** to display child data (Students)
- Create reusable **component for outer loop** (School)
- Create reusable **component for inner loop** (Student within School)
- Use `.map()` for nested structures
- Apply basic inline styling

## This is a foundational pattern when working with real-world data such as:

- Schools and Students
- Departments and Employees
- Categories and Products

## Example Code : NestedLoopMap.jsx, SchoolData.jsx,

---

## hooks

### what is hooks?

In old version of React i.e older than 16 where developers use call components. IN new versions mostly functional component is use. so to archeive state, life cycle, other features in functional component. we use hooks.

### Popular react hooks

| Hook Name           | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `useState()`        | Add local state to a function component     |
| `useEffect()`       | Perform side-effects (API calls, timers)    |
| `useContext()`      | Access context data (global/shared state)   |
| `useRef()`          | Access DOM elements or store mutable value  |
| `useReducer()`      | Alternative to `useState` for complex state |
| `useMemo()`         | Optimize performance (memoize values)       |
| `useCallback()`     | Optimize performance (memoize functions)    |
| `useLayoutEffect()` | Like `useEffect` but fires earlier          |

---

### Why Use Hooks?

React Hooks were introduced to:

- Use **stateful logic** in functional components.
- Reuse logic between components via **custom hooks**.
- Write **cleaner, smaller, and more readable** code.
- Avoid confusion between `this`, binding methods, and lifecycle methods in classes.
- Eliminate the need to convert function components into classes just to use state or lifecycle methods.

---

## History of Hooks

- **Released:** React v16.8 (February 2019)
- Motivation: React team wanted to solve common problems in class components:
- Complex component logic
- Component reusability
- Wrapper hell (Higher-order components, render props)
- Confusing lifecycle methods

---

## What is a Side Effect?

In React, a **side effect** is any action that:

- **Interacts with the outside world** (e.g., API requests, event listeners)
- **Modifies things outside the component function** (e.g., browser DOM, local storage)
- **Depends on external data** (e.g., props or global state)

---

## How to Identify a Hook?

You can easily identify a hook by the following:

- It **always starts with the word `use`**
  ```js
  useState, useEffect, useContext, useCustomHook;
  ```

---

## Why `useEffect`?

- Remove side-effects **from inside component logic** (like state updates)
- Handle side-effects **from props**
- Perform **data fetching**
- Acts as a **lifecycle method replacement**
- Use for **DOM manipulation**
- Cleanup subscriptions or timeouts
- Prevent **unwanted re-renders**

---

## useEffect state

## What It Covers

- useState and state updates
- useEffect usage with dependency array
- Function called **only when `counter` changes**
- Preventing unnecessary function calls
- Adding multiple pieces of state (`counter` and `data`)
- Updating different states with buttons

### example code: UseEffectDemo.jsx

## Handle side-effects **from props**

This example demonstrates how to **handle side effects caused by props** using React's `useEffect` hook.

---

### What It Covers

- How to **create reusable components**
- How to **pass props** from parent to child component
- How to **handle side effects** using `useEffect`
- How to use the **dependency array** to control when effects run
- Understanding **which effect triggers on which prop update**

### example code: PropsEffectDemo.jsx , PropsEffectHandler.jsx

---

## What is Component Life Cycle?

A **component life cycle** refers to the different stages a React component goes through from the moment it's created until it is removed from the DOM.

---

## Life Cycle Linked to Human Life

| Human Life Stage  | Component Life Cycle Phase        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Born              | Mounting (Component is added)     |
| Grows and changes | Updating (Props or State change)  |
| Dies              | Unmounting (Component is removed) |

Just like humans have predictable stages of life, React components follow these stages during their existence in the UI.

---

## Phases of Component Life Cycle

1. **Mounting**

   - Component is rendered for the first time.
   - `useEffect(() => {}, [])` runs once.

2. **Updating**

   - Component updates due to state or props changes.
   - `useEffect(() => {}, [dependency])` runs when dependency updates.

3. **Unmounting**
   - Component is removed from the UI.
   - Cleanup function inside `useEffect` runs.

---

### code example at: LifeCycleDemoHandle.jsx, LifeCycleDemo.jsx

## Styling React UI Using CSS

React provides **multiple ways** to apply styles to components. Each method has its use case depending on the size, structure, and complexity of your application.

---

## Types of Styling in React.js

- inline
- external
- css modules
- styled components
- external css library/ framework

---

## Inline CSS

- Defined directly in the component using the `style` attribute.
- Uses camelCase for CSS properties.
- Best for **small, dynamic styles**.

## What It Covers

- How React inline CSS is different from regular HTML style attributes.
- Using JavaScript **object syntax** to define styles.
- Creating a simple **User Profile Card layout** using inline CSS.
- Writing inline CSS in a file named: `InlineCssDemo.jsx`.
- Reusing inline styles and making **multiple profile cards**.

---

## How React Inline CSS is Different from Regular HTML Style?

| Feature               | React Inline CSS              | Regular HTML Inline Style       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Syntax                | JavaScript Object             | String                          |
| Property Naming       | camelCase (`backgroundColor`) | kebab-case (`background-color`) |
| Dynamic Value Support | Yes                           | No                              |
| Media Query Support   | No                            | No                              |

## Example: User Profile Cards with Inline CSS

### File: `InlineCssDemo.jsx`

---

## React Dynamic & Conditional Inline CSS

### What This Demo Covers

- **Dynamic and Conditional Inline CSS** using React.
- How to use `useState` for **style objects**.
- Creating **buttons to update styles dynamically**.
- **Changing theme and layout** on button click (like background color and text color).
- Conditionally rendering layout using a boolean flag.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Dynamic and Conditional Inline CSS**

React allows dynamic inline styling using JavaScript object syntax, which supports conditions and user-triggered updates.

### 2. **Using `useState` to Manage Style Objects**

```jsx
const [styleCard, setCrdStyle] = useState({
  boxShadow: "5px 5px 5px 5px",
  margin: "20px",
  padding: "10px",
  width: "350px",
});
```

### 3. **Updating Styles on Button Click**

You can update styles dynamically with functions that change state:

```jsx
const updateTheme = (bg, textColor) => {
  setCrdStyle({ ...styleCard, backgroundColor: bg });
  setColor(textColor);
};
```

### 4. **Toggle Layout or Style Conditionally**

```jsx
const [grid, setGrid] = useState(true);

<button onClick={() => setGrid(!grid)}>Toggle Grid</button>

<div style={{ display: grid ? "flex" : "block" }}>
  {/* Cards */}
</div>
```

## External CSS in React

This demo shows how to apply **External CSS** styling in a React component using a separate CSS file.

## What It Covers

- What is External CSS
- How to write External CSS
- Creating a separate `.css` file
- Writing styles in that file
- Correct way to import and apply external CSS in React

## How to Use External CSS in React

### 1. Create a CSS File

Create a file named (for example) `ExternalCSSDemo.css` in the same directory as your component.

### 2. Import CSS File into React Component

```js
import "./ExternalCSSDemo.css";
```

### 3. Use Class Names

Apply the styles using the `className` attribute in JSX:

```jsx
<h2 className="heading">External Style</h2>
<img className="img-style" src="..." alt="" />
```

## Benefits

- Cleaner JSX structure
- Easy to maintain and update styles
- Reusable across components
- Helps follow best practices and separation of concerns

## What is CSS Module?

CSS Modules is a styling approach in React that allows you to write CSS that's scoped locally to the component, rather than globally. This prevents style conflicts across components and helps manage large codebases more efficiently.

## Why We Need CSS Modules

In large applications, global CSS class names can easily conflict. CSS Modules help by **scoping styles locally to the component**. This ensures styles don’t clash or leak across components.

### Create a CSS Module File

A CSS Module file must end with `.module.css`.

**Example: `user.module.css`**

### Import CSS Module in a Component

```jsx
import style from "./CSS/cssModuleDemo.module.css";

<div className={style.mainCard}></div>;
```

### Apply Styles in Component

```jsx
<div className={style.mainCard}>
  <img src="..." className={style.img} />
</div>
```

### example code : CssModuleDemo.jsx

## style Component

### what is styled component?

**Styled-components** is a library for styling React components using a special syntax called **Tagged Template Literals**. It allows you to write actual CSS code within your JavaScript, scoped to individual components.

### Benefits:

- No class name bugs
- Automatic critical CSS
- Easier maintenance of styles
- Scoped styles by default

## Install Styled-Components

To install the `styled-components` package, use the following command:

```
npm install styled-components
```

To confirm the installation, check `package.json` for an entry like:

```json
"styled-components": "^x.x.x"
```

## How to Use Styled Components

1. **Import styled-components**:

   ```js
   import styled from "styled-components";
   ```

2. **Create styled elements** (two ways):

   - **Using JavaScript object syntax:**

     ```js
     const Heading = styled.h1({
       color: "blue",
       border: "1px solid blue",
       padding: "10px",
     });
     ```

   - **Using Tagged Template Literals:**
     ```js
     const StyleBtn = styled.button`
       color: red;
       width: 130px;
       height: 40px;
       margin: 20px;
       font-size: 20px;
     `;
     ```

3. **Use the styled elements in JSX**.

## Example Code: StyleComponentDemo.jsx

## Add Bootstrap in React

### What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

## What it Covers

- What is Bootstrap
- How to install Bootstrap
- How to import and use Bootstrap in React
- Bootstrap component examples: Button, Alert, Navbar

## How to Install Bootstrap

To install Bootstrap and React-Bootstrap in a React project, use the following commands:

- **npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap**
- Then confirm installation in `package.json`.

## How to Import Bootstrap in React

To use Bootstrap globally in your app, import Bootstrap’s CSS file in `main.jsx` or `index.js`:

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

## What is useRef?

- `useRef` is a **React Hook** that allows you to directly access and interact with a DOM element.
- Unlike state, changing a `ref` value **does not cause re-render**.

## What it Covers

- `useRef` helps manage **uncontrolled components**.
- You can directly **focus, read, or modify** the DOM element without causing a re-render.
- Useful for:

  - Setting focus
  - Controlling media playback
  - Animating elements
  - Accessing previous state values (advanced)

## Example Code: `UseRefDemo.jsx`

---

## Uncontrolled Component and useRef Demo

## What it Covers

### What is an Uncontrolled Component?

An uncontrolled component is a form input that is handled by the DOM itself, rather than React. You typically access its value using a ref or by directly querying the DOM.

### Using `querySelector`

This approach uses standard DOM methods to access the input field values.

### Using `useRef`

This approach leverages React's `useRef` hook to directly access DOM elements and their current values.

## example code: Uncontrolled.jsx;

## Passing Function as Props in React

### What It Covers

- What is **passing function as props** in React?
- Why do we need to pass function as props?
- How to make **parent and child components**
- How to **call parent function from child** using props

## Explanation

In React, **functions can be passed as props** from a parent component to a child component. This technique is used when the child needs to communicate back to the parent or trigger some logic defined in the parent.

## Parent Component Example

**File: `functionProps.jsx`**

## Child Component Example

**File: `FunctionPropsUser.jsx`**

## Output

- When you click the **User Display!!** button, it triggers `displayName(name)` in the parent.
- When you click **get function**, it runs `getFunction()` from the parent.

# React `forwardRef`

## What it Covers

- What is `forwardRef`?
- How to implement `forwardRef` before React version 19.
- How to implement `forwardRef` in React version 19 and above.

---

## What is `forwardRef`?

`forwardRef` is a React API used to forward a `ref` from a parent component to a child component. This is useful when the parent needs to directly interact with a DOM element inside the child component.

---

### `ForwardRefDemo.jsx`

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import ForwardRefUser from "./ForwardRefUser";

function ForwardRefDemo() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const updateInput = () => {
    inputRef.current.value = 1000;
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App</h1>
      <h4>Forward ref</h4>
      <User ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={updateInput}>Update input</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ForwardRefDemo;
```

### `ForwardRefUser.jsx` (React < 19)

```jsx
import { forwardRef } from "react";

function ForwardRefUser(props, ref) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={ref} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default forwardRef(ForwardRefUser);
```

## With React 19 and above (no need to use `forwardRef`)

### `ForwardRefUser.jsx` (React 19+)

## useFormStatus and useFormState in React

## What it covers

- What is `useFormStatus`?
- Example code using `useFormStatus`
- Make a form using `<form>` tag
- Handle form submission with `action`
- Show status during form submission (like a loader or disable button)

## what is `useFormStatus`

`useFormStatus` is a React hook provided by **react-dom** that helps track the pending state of a form submission.You can use it to show loading indicators, disable buttons, or give feedback while the form is submitting.`useFormStatus` is useful in forms that need loading or state indication.IT is ideal for **Submit** button status control.

# useTransition Hook in React

## What it Covers

- What is `useTransition`?
- How to use `useTransition` with an example
- Create buttons with async logic using both `useState` and `useTransition`

## What is `useTransition`?

The `useTransition` hook is used to mark state updates as non-urgent. This can be useful for keeping the app responsive when rendering large UI trees.

## example code: UseTransitionDemo.jsx

## exaination of code

- `useState` is used for normal state management and can cause blocking behavior during updates.
- `useTransition` helps prioritize urgent updates and keeps less important tasks in the background.
